# Alix Router
Home Router

My home netowrk router is an Alix
[APU box](http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm) running
[OpenBSD](http://OpenBSD.org/) The flash image was created using
[flashrd](http://www.nmedia.net/flashrd/).

My home network has two networks. A private network and a Guest Netwok.

The private network is where my home servers, laptop and wife's laptop
are connected. The laptops are connected though an Apple Airport
Extreme __configured as access point__.

On the guest network are connected all the devices that I deem not
secure. Such as my guest laptops, but also the Nest Thermostat, Nest
Cam or the WEMO plugs. The guest network has no access to my private
network. All the connections are done through an old generation
Airport Extreme __configured as an access point__
